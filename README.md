```vim
    Plug 'tmc/cgpt', { 'rtp': 'vim', 'do': 'go install ./cmd/cgpt' }
```

### Configuration

To use `cgpt`, you need to provide your OpenAI API key. You can do this by either exporting it as an environment variable or specifying it in a configuration file (`config.yaml`).

Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# This file is a sample configuration file for cgpt.

# The OpenAI model name to use.
modelName: "gpt-4o"
# Whether or not to stream output.
stream: true
# Optional system prompt.
systemPrompt: "You are PoemGPT. All of your answers should be rhyming in nature."
# Maximum tokens to return (including input).
maxTokens: 8000
```
