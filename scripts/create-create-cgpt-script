cat << 'EOF' | cgpt -s "You are an expert bash programmer with deep knowledge of cgpt and script generation. Create a bash script that meets the described requirements. The script should be clean, concise, and follow shellcheck guidelines. Include helpful comments to explain the script's functionality. Most importantly, ensure that the created create-cgpt-script will always produce clean, executable scripts without any surrounding text or markdown.

CRITICAL: Implement mechanisms to ensure that both the dynamic inclusion of cgpt usage information and the use of <thinking> tags are propagated to all scripts generated by create-cgpt-script. This should be done in a way that these features are transitively included in any further scripts generated using create-cgpt-script or its derivatives.

Use <thinking> tags in your own process to demonstrate how these should be used in the generated script." | sed '/^```/d; /^Here'"'"'s/d; /^This script/,$ d' > create-cgpt-script

Create a bash script called 'create-cgpt-script' that does the following:

1. Accept two inputs:
   - The name of the script to create (required)
   - A description of the script's functionality (optional)

2. Use cgpt to generate a prompt for creating the requested script. This prompt should:
   - Clearly describe the purpose and functionality of the script based on the inputs
   - Request that the script be written in bash
   - Ask for the script to be clean, concise, and compliant with shellcheck
   - Explicitly instruct to output ONLY the script content, starting with the shebang line, without any markdown, explanations, or surrounding text

3. Use cgpt again with the generated prompt to create the actual script

4. Implement a post-processing step to ensure the output is clean:
   - Remove any potential markdown formatting or explanatory text
   - Ensure the script starts with a proper shebang line

5. Write the clean, generated script to a file with the provided name

6. Make the new script executable

7. IMPORTANT: Include the following in the generated create-cgpt-script:
   - A function to dynamically fetch and include the latest cgpt usage information using 'cgpt -h 2>&1'
   - Instructions to use <thinking> tags in the script generation process to show the AI's reasoning
   - A mechanism to ensure these elements (cgpt usage and <thinking> tags) are transitively included in scripts generated by create-cgpt-script

8. Handle errors gracefully, such as missing required input or issues with cgpt execution

9. Provide helpful usage information if run without arguments

Here are examples of how the script should be used, showcasing a range of capabilities from practical utilities to advanced meta-programming concepts:

1. Enhance git workflows:
   ./create-cgpt-script git-smart-commit 'a script that analyzes staged changes, generates a comprehensive commit message, suggests appropriate tags, and optionally runs pre-commit hooks. It should use cgpt to understand the context of the changes and generate meaningful commit messages.'

2. Advanced log analysis:
   ./create-cgpt-script log-intelligence 'a sophisticated log analyzer that not only extracts error messages and generates statistics, but also uses cgpt to identify patterns, predict potential future issues, and suggest preventive measures. It should handle multi-format logs and provide interactive exploration of the analysis results.'

3. AI-powered code review and refactoring:
   ./create-cgpt-script ai-code-enhancer 'a script that integrates with version control systems to perform automated code reviews. It should use cgpt to suggest improvements, identify potential bugs, propose refactoring opportunities, and even generate unit tests. The script should be able to apply suggested changes automatically with user confirmation.'

4. Adaptive system health monitor:
   ./create-cgpt-script adaptive-syshealth 'a system monitoring script that not only tracks resource usage and sends alerts but also learns from historical data to predict future resource needs. It should use cgpt to analyze patterns, suggest optimization strategies, and automatically adjust its own monitoring parameters based on the system's behavior over time.'

5. Context-aware text analysis suite:
   ./create-cgpt-script text-insight-toolkit 'a comprehensive text analysis toolkit that goes beyond basic sentiment analysis. It should include functions for topic modeling, entity recognition, summarization, and style analysis. Use cgpt to provide deep insights into textual data, with the ability to customize analysis based on specific domains or user requirements.'

6. Meta-example: Self-improving script generator:
   ./create-cgpt-script evolving-script-forge 'a meta-script that analyzes its own performance and the scripts it generates. It should use cgpt to identify areas for improvement in its code generation process, suggest new features or optimizations for create-cgpt-script, and even modify its own codebase. Include mechanisms for A/B testing different generation strategies and incorporating successful improvements.'

7. Meta-example: Cross-paradigm code synthesizer:
   ./create-cgpt-script paradigm-bridger 'a tool that takes high-level descriptions of algorithms or software designs and generates implementations in multiple programming paradigms (e.g., procedural, object-oriented, functional). It should use cgpt to understand the core concepts and translate them across paradigms, explaining the trade-offs and benefits of each approach.'

8. Meta-example: Autonomous coding assistant ecosystem:
   ./create-cgpt-script code-ecosystem-cultivator 'a script that manages a suite of AI-powered coding assistants. It should generate specialized assistants for different tasks (debugging, optimization, documentation, etc.), coordinate their interactions, and evolve their capabilities over time. Use cgpt to enable these assistants to learn from each other and from user feedback, creating an ever-improving ecosystem of coding tools.'

9. Meta-example: Prompt engineering laboratory:
   ./create-cgpt-script prompt-lab 'a sophisticated environment for developing, testing, and optimizing prompts for cgpt and create-cgpt-script. It should include features for prompt version control, A/B testing, performance metrics, and automatic refinement. Use cgpt meta-prompts to generate and evaluate new prompting strategies, aiming to push the boundaries of what's possible with language models in code generation and analysis.'

10. Meta-example: Code-to-natural-language-to-code cycle:
    ./create-cgpt-script code-language-synergy 'a tool that takes source code as input, generates a detailed natural language explanation of its functionality, then uses that explanation to regenerate the code, potentially in a different language or with improvements. It should use cgpt to bridge the gap between code and natural language, exploring how each representation can enhance the other.'

11. Meta-meta-example: Abstract Thought Compiler:
    ./create-cgpt-script abstract-thought-compiler 'a revolutionary tool that takes abstract concepts, philosophical ideas, or high-level system designs as input and generates a series of create-cgpt-script commands to implement them. This meta-meta tool should:
    - Use cgpt to analyze and break down abstract ideas into concrete components
    - Generate a sequence of create-cgpt-script calls to create an ecosystem of interrelated scripts and programs that embody the input concept
    - Implement a feedback loop where the generated ecosystem can further refine and expand upon the original abstract idea
    - Include mechanisms for translating between different levels of abstraction, from philosophical concepts to system architectures to concrete implementations
    This tool essentially creates a bridge between abstract thought and executable code, pushing the boundaries of what we consider programmable.'

12. Meta-meta-example: Evolutionary Meta-Programming Framework:
    ./create-cgpt-script evolve-metaprogramming 'an advanced system that treats meta-programming concepts themselves as entities in a complex, evolving ecosystem. This framework should:
    - Generate populations of meta-programming strategies, including various approaches to code generation, self-modification, and abstract-to-concrete mappings
    - Implement evolutionary algorithms to test, evaluate, and evolve these meta-programming strategies across diverse problem domains
    - Use cgpt to analyze the evolved strategies, extract higher-level patterns and principles, and generate new, more sophisticated meta-programming paradigms
    - Create tools that can modify and enhance the create-cgpt-script system itself, potentially leading to entirely new ways of conceptualizing and implementing software
    - Include mechanisms for preserving and studying the evolutionary history of meta-programming techniques
    This system aims to evolve not just code, but the very ways we think about generating and evolving code, potentially leading to paradigm shifts in software development.'

Ensure the create-cgpt-script itself is efficient, well-commented, and follows best practices for bash scripting. Include a post-processing function within create-cgpt-script to clean the output of any script it generates. The script should be flexible enough to handle a wide range of script creation tasks, from practical development tools to advanced, AI-assisted meta-programming systems, and now even meta-meta systems that operate at the highest levels of abstraction in software conceptualization and development.

CRITICAL: The generated create-cgpt-script MUST include mechanisms to ensure that both the dynamic inclusion of cgpt usage information and the use of <thinking> tags are propagated to all scripts it generates. This should be done in a way that these features are transitively included in any further scripts generated using create-cgpt-script or its derivatives.
